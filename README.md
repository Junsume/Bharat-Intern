# Machine Learning Models Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Models repository! Here you will find implementations of two popular machine learning models along with their datasets - a House Price Prediction model and an Iris Classification model.

## House Price Prediction Model

### Overview
This model predicts the prices of houses based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc. It utilizes a regression algorithm to predict continuous values.

### Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing this model can be found in the `housing.csv` file.

### Implementation
The House Price Prediction model is implemented in the `house_price_pred.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Iris Classification Model

### Overview
This model classifies iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on the length and width of sepals and petals. It utilizes a classification algorithm to assign classes to input data.

### Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing this model can be found in the `IRIS.csv` file.

### Implementation
The Iris Classification model is implemented in the `iris_classification.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## How to Use
To use these models, simply clone the repository and open the respective Jupyter Notebooks in your preferred environment. Follow the instructions provided in each notebook to train the models and make predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
